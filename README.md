## PROJECT OVERVIEW

>The project will feature a website that will help introduce new Trent students (specifically international students) to Trent University.  Here they will find various >information and steps all in one place (such as what to do after accepting their offer letter, how to register for courses and how to use MyTrent). The website will >consolidate all the information a new student should know when coming to Trent in one place. The website will have ordered steps in a “Level-like” format as we see in >games. This way the students can track their requirements and tasks at each level and not miss a step.

>The product in development will receive bi-weekly feedback from the Client, Paul Longhurst and Trent International to help create a better user experience. New >features will be added and tested every Sprint leading up to the final product.
