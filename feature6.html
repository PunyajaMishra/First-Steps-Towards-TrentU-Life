        <h1>Step 05: Classes and Credits</h1>
        <h2>What are Credits? What Classes Do I register for?</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have activated your myTrent Portal, Trent Email address
          and secured a housing for yourself, its time look into the
          <b>next important steps: Course Registrations</b>. It is important to
          understand what your degree requirements are to be able to understand
          what courses you need to register for.
        </p>
        <h2>What are Credits? How are they different from a course?</h2>
        <p>
          Courses are either 0.5 credit or 1.0 credit. If a course indicates an
          “H” at the end of the course code, it is a half credit course (0.5).
          If the course indicates a “Y” at the end of the course code, it is a
          full credit course (1.0)
        </p>
        <h2>Degree Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Every degree has their own "
          <a
            href="https://www.trentu.ca/advising/course-selection-and-registration/understanding-your-degree-requirements"

            Degree Requirements</a
          >" which consists of credits and courses that needs to be fulfilled in
          order to graduate with the said degree. A credit is a way of keeping a
          'count' on these required courses for a degree and a student required
          a certain number of Completed Credits to graduate.
        </p>
        <p>
          A degree requirements consists of 2 types of requirements - Program
          Requirements & University Requirements. It is important to keep these
