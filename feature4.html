          Linus Torvalds Finnish computer scientist By The Editors of
          Encyclopaedia Britannica Edit History Linus Torvalds Linus Torvalds
          See all media Born: December 28, 1969 (age 52) Helsinki Finland
          Inventions: Linux Subjects Of Study: operating system Linus Torvalds,
          (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish computer
          scientist who was the principal force behind the development of the
          Linux operating system. At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer
          programming on his grandfather’s Commodore VIC-20. In 1991, while a
          computer science student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996),
          he purchased his first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied,
          however, with the computer’s operating system (OS). His PC used MS-DOS
          (the disk operating system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds
          preferred the UNIX operating system he had used on the university’s
          computers. He decided to create his own PC-based version of UNIX.
          Months of determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an
          operating system known as Linux. In 1991 he posted a message on the
          Internet to alert other PC users to his new system, made the software
          available for free downloading, and, as was a common practice among
          software developers at the time, he released the source code, which
          meant that anyone with knowledge of computer programming could modify
          Linux to suit their own purposes. Because of their access to the
          source code, many programmers helped Torvalds retool and refine the
          software, and by 1994 Linux kernel (original code) version 1.0 was
          released. ball bearing. Disassembled ball bearing. rotational friction

          invented the ball bearing that reduces rotational friction? Let the
          wheels in your head turn while testing your knowledge of inventors and
          their inventions in this quiz. Operating Linux required a certain
          amount of technical acumen; it was not as easy to use as more popular
          operating systems such as Windows, Apple’s Mac OS, or IBM OS/2.
          However, Linux evolved into a remarkably reliable, efficient system
          that rarely crashed. Linux became popular in the late 1990s when
          competitors of Microsoft began taking the upstart OS seriously.
          Netscape Communications Corp., Corel Corp., Oracle Corp., Intel Corp.,
          and other companies announced plans to support Linux as an inexpensive
          alternative to Windows. In addition to Linux being free, its source
          code can be viewed and freely modified by anyone, unlike a proprietary
          OS. This means that different language versions can be developed and
          deployed in markets that would be too small for the traditional
          companies. Also, many organizations and governments have expressed
          security reservations about using any kind of computer software that
          contains code that cannot be viewed. Combined with Apache, an
          open-source Web server, Linux accounts for most of the servers used on
          the Internet. Because it is open-source, and thus modifiable for
          different uses, Linux is popular for systems as diverse as cellular
          telephones and supercomputers. Android, Google’s operating system for
          mobile devices, has at its core a modified Linux kernel, and Chrome
          OS, Google’s operating system, which uses the Chrome browser, is also
          Linux-based. The addition of user-friendly desktop environments,
          office suites, Web browsers, and even games helped to increase Linux’s
          popularity and make it more suitable for home and office desktops. In
          1997 Torvalds took a position with Transmeta Corp., a microprocessor
          manufacturer, and relocated to California. Six years later he left the
          company to work as a project coordinator under the auspices of the
          Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium created by such
          high-tech companies as IBM, Intel, and Siemens to promote Linux
          development. In 2007 OSDL merged with the Free Standards Group to form
          the Linux Foundation. In 2012 he was awarded the Millennium Technology
          Prize by the foundation Technology Academy Finland. The Editors of

          advocate who founded (1985) the Free Software Foundation. Stallman
          earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from Harvard University in 1974.
          In 1971, as a freshman at Harvard, he had begun working at the
          Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (later Computer Science &
          Artificial Intelligence Lab) at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT). There he wrote the Emacs text editor in the C

          on his GNU Project, or GNU operating system. GNU was intended to be a
          free version of AT&T’s UNIX, and the name GNU was created as a
          recursive acronym of GNU’s not UNIX. One of the last of the “hackers,”
          computer programmers who strongly believed in freely modifying and
          sharing computer code, Stallman left MIT in 1984 over concerns about
          changes to the university’s software copyright rules; however, he
          later returned as a visiting scientist. In 1985 Stallman created the
          nonprofit Free Software Foundation, which initially focused on
          supporting his GNU Project. In 1990 he was awarded a MacArthur
          fellowship, the so-called “genius award” that gives recipients a
          substantial financial stipend with no strings attached. The award
          helped free Stallman to write various utilities for the GNU Project,
          such as the GNU Emacs editor, GNU compiler, and GNU debugger, which
          would later be combined with the kernel developed by Linus Torvalds, a
          Finnish computer science student, to produce the GNU/Linux, or Linux,
          operating system in 1994. Stallman’s GNU Emacs Manual, which has gone
          through numerous revisions, is freely available from the GNU Web site.
          With the release of a free operating system, Stallman and the Free
          Software Foundation focused on promoting free software and the
          development of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), commonly
          known as a copyleft agreement, which gives authors a way to allow
          their works to be modified without releasing them to the public
          domain. In 1999 Stallman published “The Free Universal Encyclopedia
          and Learning Resource,” a paper calling for the creation of an
          open-source encyclopaedia. Almost as soon as he set up the GNUpedia
          Project, another open-source encyclopaedia project, Nupedia, the
          predecessor of Wikipedia, appeared and adopted the GNU Free
          Documentation License, so the work on the GNUpedia Project was merged
          into Nupedia. True to his hacker roots, Stallman continued to promote
          free software around the world, though he had limited success in
          convincing governments to move completely to free software. He was one
          of the principal people interviewed and profiled in the 2001
          documentary Revolution OS by American director J.T.S. Moore. Get a

          attempting to discredit an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein, a

          Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994.
          About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and
          the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating
          system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman and the FSF
          started by creating utilities for the operating system first. These
          utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to create a complete
          system called GNU/Linux, or, less precisely, just Linux. computer
