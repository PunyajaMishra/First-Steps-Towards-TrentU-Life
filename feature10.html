        <h2>What to bring to residence?</h2>
        <p>
          If you are living in a residence, there a few thing that are very useful. Keep in mind, 
          that these are a recommended and suggested list. If there is anything that you are unable
          to bring with you, no porblem, there is always a substitute or solution to it. Check out 
          <a href="https://www.trentu.ca/housing/sites/trentu.ca.housing/files/documents/NEW-%20What%20to%20bring%20to%20residence%20.pdf">

          Feel free to print it out to have it handy while completing your shopping!
        </p>
        <h2>Packing</h2>
        <p>
            Fitting your entire life in a suitcase to bring with you to a new contry is difficult and may seem 
            like a daunting task, but it is also a chance to start fresh. Try to start packing simply for the 
            immediate future as you will find most things in Canada. Packing your documents and essentials are 
            important. Bear in mind that many small appliances from abroad may not work in Canada as the voltage
            system may be different from that of your home country.
        </p>
        <h2>In your Carry-On</h2>
        <p>
            There are some thigns that you need to keep in your carry on luggae as you will be needing
            these as soon as you arrive or sometime during your arrival. 
            <ul>
              <li>Passport</li>
              <li>Visa</li>
              <li>Study Permit</li>
              <li>Proof of Enrollment</li>

              <li>Travel Insurance</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out <a href="feature9.html">Step 08</a> for more informaiton on documents.
        </p>
        <h2>Items you should pack</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobile with international roaming</li>
            <li>Mobile Charger</li>
            <li>Laptop</li>
            <li>Laptop Charger</li>
            <li>Converter - for voltage and plugpoint differences</li>
            <li>Power Bar - recommended but not a necessity</li>
            <li>Toiletries</li>
            <li>Books</li>
            <li>Items that remind you of home - photos/books</li>
            <li>Medicines with Prescriptions if necessary</li>
            <li>Light bed linens (bed sheets, pillow cases)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Seasonal Clothing</h2>
        <p>
          Weather can range between -40C to 40C depending on the area you are residing with. 
          Therefore, it is important to be equipped with all types of clothes for varying seasons. 
          <ul>
            <li>Spring and Summer: Light-weight clothnig is best</li>
            <li>Spring and fall: Sweaters and light waterproof jackets are useful for cool and rainy days</li>
            <li>Winter: Heavy Jackets, scarves, gloves, hats, waterproof boots</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Packing for Winter</h2>
        <p>
          If you are moving from a 'not so cold' place then you will be encountering colder weather
          than you have experienced before. That is why it is important to pack th eright winter clothes
          for Canada. Again, bear in mind, winter jackets, snow boots, good thermals and gloves/hats/mufflers 
          can be found in Canada. If you are arriving in Winter and plan to buy from Canada, it will be difficult for you 
          to step outside without the right clothes, so please get a 'starter-kit' to continue your sopping in Canada'
          <ul>
            <li>Thermals</li>
            <li>Glvoes</li>
            <li>Boots</li>
            <li>Jackets</li>
            <li>Snow hats</li>
            <li>Mufflers</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Items you can buy in Canada</h2>
        <p>
          It is scary to move into another country all by yourself and therefore everyone wishes to get as 
          much as they can from their home. ITs a new country and you are worried about not finding the things you need 
          and that is completely understandable. It is recommended that you buy bulkier or heavier items once you have arrived 
          especially if you have luggage allowance. Items that you can buy here include basic ammenities such as 
          pillows, sheets, towels, clenaing supplies, hangers, as well as winter clothes. You can also ship a few stuff 
          to Canada - please contact your Residence Life Coordinator if you will be living on-campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also choose to bring all these items with you instead of relying 
          on buig once you arrive to Canada. Just make sure to follow your budget, flight luggage specifications, and 
          your comfort as it can be a long journey. 
        </p>
        <h2>At your Home Country's Airport</h2>
        <p>
          Like any other international flight, try to be on the airport at least 3 hours before your flight time.
          Keep your passport and all other documents in a folder and in your carry-on bag, NOT the 
          checked-in luggage. This way it is readily available. You will need this while checking in. 
        </p>
        <h2>At the Canadian Airport</h2>
        <p>
          When you arrive in Canada, you will meet a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer">
            border services officer
          </a>  who will make sure 
          you meet some basic requirements - they will check you official documents. 
          Check more information on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival.html">IRCC</a>.
